This is my very first **FREE** script I have developed over the last few days, This script creates a loadout menu available for emergency services (Mainly Police) to spawn weapons and firearms they may need while on duty.

## In-game Usage

**Open Menu:** /loadout
**While In Menu:** Navigate the menu using UP/DOWN arrows, and press ENTER to select each "button", then press BACKSPACE to close the menu
