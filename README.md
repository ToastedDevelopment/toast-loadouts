This is my very first **FREE** script I have developed over the last few days, This script creates a loadout menu available for emergency services (Mainly Police) to spawn weapons and firearms they may need while on duty.

## In-game Usage

When in game simply use **“/loadout”** to open the menu and access all weapons that are fully customizable to the server owners liking, with the ability to add more or less weapons, as well as the ability to return all weapons back and remove them from the players weapon wheel!

Use the **UP/DOWN** arrows to navigate the menu, **ENTER** to select a button to spawn or remove a weapon, and **BACKSPACE** to close the menu and get back to roleplay!

We have also created the ability for users to add a key bind for this menu so they can open with ease to avoid using chat commands as much as they wish!
